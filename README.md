# 2PC-TLA-
Implementation of TLA+ with model checker for the two phase commit protocol with node failures

TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling programs and systems--especially concurrent and distributed ones.  
It's based on the idea that the best way to describe things precisely is with simple mathematics.  TLA+ and its tools are 
useful for eliminating fundamental design errors, which are hard to find and expensive to correct in code.

In transaction processing, databases, and computer networking, the two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is a type of atomic 
commitment protocol (ACP). It is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed 
atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction (it is a specialized type of consensus protocol). 
The protocol achieves its goal even in many cases of temporary system failure (involving either process, network node, 
communication, etc. failures), and is thus widely used.
